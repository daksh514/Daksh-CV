          I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on
          algorithms and networks, the roles they play in large-scale social and
          information systems, and their broader societal implications. My work
          has been supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator
          Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation
          Fellowship, a Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation
          Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and grants from
          Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the
          NSF. I am a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National
          Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
